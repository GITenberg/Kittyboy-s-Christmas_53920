<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 2.5em;">CHAPTER I</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Kittyboy</span> was lost. It was an evident
fact. He stood on the corner
of the alley which led into a wide street to
which he had been chased by an aggressive
dog, and with every hair bristling,
looked around for a friendly door, but they
were all shut closely; and the snow was
beginning to fall, in an uncertain way, just
a flake here and there, displaying exquisitely
perfect crystals on the stone steps
and the brick pavement, then melting away
very slowly.</p>

<p>Kittyboy tucked his four small paws
neatly under him, and crouched in a corner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
once in a while giving a plaintive little
"meow," which no one noticed, if any one
heard. Yet, after all, Kittyboy's losing of
himself was not such a dreadful thing, for
he was always being kicked aside as a
troublesome beast, even before his little
mistress, Annie Brady, was sent away to a
Home, being considered by her uncle's
family in the light of a nuisance, quite as
great as Kittyboy himself. Nevertheless,
in spite of his rather unpleasant experiences
in the world, Kittyboy was full of a
happy confidence in humanity scarcely to
be expected. So, presently seeing a figure
coming up the street, he rose from his
compact attitude and ran along by the
railing of an area, rubbing his sides against
the narrow bars, and finally followed the
figure up the broad steps; then, as the
latch-key was turned in the door, he saw
his opportunity, and slipped in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>It was rather late; eleven o'clock or
more, and getting colder every minute.
The house was very quiet, no one astir
anywhere; a light, however, was burning
in one room, where a warm fire blazed
in the open grate, the sight of which
so delighted Kittyboy that he began to
purr contentedly. The light, now turned
up, showed more distinctly what manner
of person it was whom Kittyboy had followed:
an elderly man, with keen, sharp
eyes; he was somewhat portly, was well
dressed, and brisk in his movements.
Kittyboy's little black form, snuggled in
one corner, where he sat blinking at the
fire, was not noticed by this other occupant
of the room, who, lighting a cigar,
sat down by a table, stretched out his
legs comfortably, and unfolded the evening
paper.</p>

<p>Presently, the sharp sound of a coal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
dropping on the polished hearth disturbed
Kittyboy's nap, and he jumped up, with
visions of whips cracking over his head,
and gave a leap away from the fire. The
sharp noise also attracted the attention
of the reader, who looked over the top
of his newspaper to see four little furry
feet daintily stepping across the rug.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here! Get out,
cat!" came an exclamation in so much
milder language than that to which Kittyboy
was accustomed, that he considered it
in the light of an overture, and springing
up on the arm of the chair, in which this
new acquaintance was sitting, he proceeded
to play with the newspaper, patting
the two sides, with ears very much
forward, and an alert look on the wise
little face, as if in momentary expectation
of seeing a mouse jump out from the
folds of the sheet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>The very audacity of the performance
tickled the man's fancy. "You impudent
little beast," he said; "how did you get in
here, anyhow? Aha! I know. I believe I
saw you as I came up the steps. You
must have slipped in behind me. But this
will never do; you will have to get out
again. No cats allowed in my house."</p>

<p>For answer, Kittyboy began to rub his
head against the arm nearest him, purring
softly.</p>

<p>The man regarded him less severely.
"If I'm going to turn you out, I may as
well give you something to eat. You are
none too well fed, I see," he remarked;
and, rising, he took his way to another
room, where, after hunting around, he
found in the larder a pitcher of cream, set
away by the housekeeper for her master's
morning coffee. All unconscious of bringing
dismay to the worthy woman, Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Brewster emptied the contents of the
pitcher in a saucer and set it down, watching
Kittyboy eagerly lap up this unexpected
treat.</p>

<p>"Now you must go," said the doctor;
and Kittyboy followed confidently at his
heels. But the draught of icy wind which
greeted him as the front door was opened,
caused the little fellow to scamper back to
the library, where, before the open fire, he
again sat down and began complacently to
wash his face.</p>

<p>Back into the room came Dr. Brewster,
laughing in spite of himself. "You
are a sly little rascal," he said; "come,
come," and he picked up the unresisting
little creature, which cuddled down comfortably
in his arms, as if it were beyond
the bounds of possibility that a second
attempt should be made to put him out,
and the good doctor actually began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
have compunctions. "I always vowed I'd
never have a cat in the house," he said,
under his breath; "am I to give in at
this late day? Well! you audacious little
wretch, I'll let you stay till morning. It's
too cold a night to turn any creature out of
doors," and Kittyboy's triumph was complete
when he was put down on the hearth-rug
and allowed to continue his ablutions,
while the doctor resumed his paper.</p>

<p>But it was strange that the presence
of a little black cat could turn a sober
man's interest from foreign news and the
quotations of the stock market, and that
he should have found himself dwelling on
the memory of two little eager faces which
he had seen that day gazing into a window
decked out with Christmas toys, and,
furthermore, that twice he should have
read over an item which went as follows:</p>

<p>"Every year, about Christmas time, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
number of letters find their way to the
Post Office; they are variously addressed
to Santa Claus, Kris Kringle, or St. Nicholas,
and are the outcome of childish faith.
One is forced to wonder how often they
must be followed by disappointment, since
there can appear no claimant for them."</p>

<p>The doctor, we have said, read the
paragraph twice over, and then, lowering
his paper, sat looking thoughtfully into the
fire. After a while a smile broke over his
face, and he returned to his sheet. But
the smile did not leave his lips till he
extinguished the light and went to his
room, leaving the sleeping Kittyboy curled
up on the hearth-rug in a condition of
delicious warmth and comfort.</p>

<p>When, the next morning, at the sight
of buckets and brooms brought in by
the housemaid, Kittyboy scampered out, it
was to find refuge in the dining-room, just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
as the doctor opened the door to go to his
breakfast. This time Kittyboy was not
driven out, for the cheery waitress said,
"It brings good luck, doctor, sorr, to have
a cat come to the house, especially a black
cat." And by the time the doctor had
finished, indulgently feeding Kittyboy with
bits from his own plate, and Kittyboy had
responded by such antics as kept the doctor
laughing, it was an understood thing
that the little cat was fairly adopted into
the family.</p>

<p>The invasion of a common little street
cat into the bachelor's household quite
scandalized the good housekeeper, who
could not get it out of her head that Kittyboy
had in some way purloined the cream,
but, said the cheerful Maggie, "It's far too
quiet here to suit me, and the doctor actually
ate his breakfast this morning without
the paper at his elbow. I certainly am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
glad to see some sort of a young creature
about the house." The housekeeper gave
a sniff, but even she smiled furtively a
moment later at sight of Kittyboy wildly
chasing his tail.</p>

<p>Buttoning himself up well in his overcoat,
the doctor, after breakfast, took his
way down town, and went straight to the
city Post Office. He did not stop as he
passed through the long corridor till he
reached the private office of the Postmaster
himself.</p>

<p>"Hello, Brewster, what brings you
here so early?" questioned that worthy,
looking up from his desk. "Haven't any
complaints to make about Uncle Sam's
mail, have you? Don't be too hard on
us if things aren't just on time. There is
a great rush from now till after the holidays,
and you old bachelors are so
methodical that, if a letter is a minute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and a quarter late, you think the entire
Post Office system is tottering. Sit down."</p>

<p>"No," replied the doctor. "I didn't
come to complain, Hardy, I came to see if
I could collect the mail for Santa Claus."</p>

<p>Mr. Hardy put down his pen, and
stared at his visitor. "What are you
driving at, anyhow?" he asked. "Oh, I
see; some charity Christmas tree, or
something. How much will let me off,
doc?"</p>

<p>The doctor smiled. "I'm not on that
errand at all. I simply want to know if it
is possible to have any letters, now lying
in this office, addressed to Santa Claus,
delivered to me?"</p>

<p>Mr. Hardy looked thoughtful for a
moment. "Are there any such letters?"
he then asked.</p>

<p>The doctor felt in his pocket for the
last evening's paper, which he had taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the precaution to carry with him, and
silently pointed out the paragraph he had
read the night before.</p>

<p>Mr. Hardy nodded understandingly.
"I don't see why you shouldn't have
them," he replied finally; "I'll get them for
you, doc, if it's possible," and, leaving the
office, he presently returned with about
half a dozen letters, which he handed to his
friend. "There you are," he said. "No
need to ask what you're going to do with
them. It's just like the things you used
to do when we were lads. It takes me
back to the old days when Christmas comes
around. Come up and see us, doc; the
latch string is always out," and he turned
to his desk, as the doctor with his budget
left the room.</p>

<p>The latter went directly to his club,
and opened the funny, smudgy little notes.
Some of them printed; some sprawled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
across a wide page, some very zig-zag and
uncertain.</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">"<i>Don't, good Santa Claus, forget
our corner</i>," read one, "<i>20uth and
Purl street, if you can't git down the
chimney cause they are reggyters
come in the window, we'll leave it a
little bit open so you can hist it easy</i>.</p>

<p style="text-align: right; margin-bottom: 2em;">"<span class="smcap">Bob.</span>"</p>

</blockquote>

<p>"That youngster's all right," nodded
the doctor. "I know the locality, and
there's not a doubt but that his stocking
will be well-filled."</p>

<p>The next was printed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">"<i>I am a good girl bring me the
doll. Fill wants a bow narrow</i>,"</p></blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">&mdash;but there was no address, and this, too,
was laid aside.</p>

<p>Then came a queer little, half-printed,
half-written epistle:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">"<span class="smcap">Dear Santa</span>: <i>I want a new
papa and a new kitten. Conny says
kittens are easy enuff to get, but
papas are much harder and very
spensive. but I dont want just any
kitten please, cause my dear Jollity
was black and all the kittens this year
are grey. if you have any black ones
to spare please bring me one and a
papa with a red ribbon around its
neck. dont go to grandpas at Fort
wurth where we were last year cause
we aint there now we are at 610 west
12 street.</i></p>

<p style="text-align: right; margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 2em;">"<span class="smcap">Elinor Temple.</span>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the doctor read the signature a red
flush mounted to his forehead, and he cast
a confused look around him; then he
slipped the letter into his pocket, took two
or three turns up and down the room, and
returned to his examination of the rest of
the mail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>The last two letters were pitiful appeals
from homes of want and misery; timid little
requests, full of childish faith, which made
the doctor shake his head and blink his
eyes, frowning the while. These letters
he also put aside, and then paced the floor
in deep thought.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 2.5em;">CHAPTER II</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was high noon when he turned toward
home. He had forgotten all about
Kittyboy, but when the confident little
beastie came rubbing up against him, purring
softly, the doctor smiled, as if a sudden
thought had struck him, and stooping
down, he rubbed Kittyboy's head; after
which performance the artful little creature
rolled over on his back, and turned his
gold-colored eyes upon the doctor, inviting
a frolic; then up and away he scudded,
with arched back and curved tail, the very
embodiment of a witch's familiar.</p>

<p>"You little imp of darkness!" cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the doctor. "Such capers in the house of
a sober bachelor! You'll be occupying
my bedroom next and calling it your
own." A prediction which speedily came
true, for that very night Kittyboy slyly
crept up behind the doctor, and, hiding
himself, craftily bided his time, and in the
dead of night stole forth and curled himself
up on the foot of the bed, waking the
doctor in the morning by licking his hand
with a red, rough, little tongue. And
then followed wild, frantic gambols, dancing
and prancing over everything; coquettings
with the tassels of a dressing gown;
tussles with a slipper; mock fears of a
very innocent reflection in the glass; delicate
tip-toeings about the dressing table,
with attempts to pry into every box and
drawer; then one leap into the air and a
waltzing after a little black tail whose
existence Kittyboy seemed only that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
moment to have discovered. All this so
entertained the doctor, that he lay in bed
shaking with laughter at the absurd antics,
and went down to breakfast with Kittyboy
on his shoulder.</p>

<p>After this it was evident that Kittyboy
considered the second-story front bedroom
as his own. To be sure he generously
allowed Dr. Brewster to share it, to
occupy the bed, if he were not in the middle
of it; or the doctor might sit in any
comfortable chair for which Kittyboy had
no immediate use; but the lordly little
creature took possession so absolutely
that the doctor's sense of humor was
greatly tickled by this overweening complacency
and confidence, and he meekly
took another chair when Kittyboy occupied
the better one, or, indeed, moved
over to the right side of the bed if Kittyboy
preferred the left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the evening of the day which
had seen the doctor at the Post Office. It
seemed to him that it had been many
more than twenty-four hours since the sly
little cat had followed him indoors, and had
ingratiated himself into the good man's
favor. Already the doctor was making
a confidant of this same little waif.</p>

<p>"What would you do about it, you
little limb of Satan?" he asked, as he
opened the letter he had so carefully put
aside that morning. "Come, you shall
decide. Let us see what sort of oracle
you can make. You started this, anyhow,
as I remember. Now get me out of it, if
you can."</p>

<p>Kittyboy winked soberly, as the doctor
thus addressed him, but looked very
wise, as if he knew much more than he
proposed to tell.</p>

<p>The doctor softly stroked the black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
fur, which was less rough than it had been
the day before. "Shall I go or not?" he
asked. "You can advise, and then, like
others in the same position, I'll do as I
choose. Here is the letter." He shook
it at the little creature, who grabbed it in
both paws, rolled over with it once or
twice, then taking it in his mouth he
jumped down from the table and walked
off with his prize to the chair where a soft
felt hat of the doctor's was lying. Into
this jumped Kittyboy, letter and all, and,
curling himself up, looked with a knowing
wink at the man who was watching him.</p>

<hr class="chap" style="page-break-after: always;" />

<p>"Nothing could be plainer," laughed
the doctor. "Go is the word. Pick up
your hat and its contents, you say. Here
we are, take us and go. Such wisdom!
For real out and out witchcraft, commend
me to a black cat. Ah, Kittyboy, it is well
you did not live in the time of those old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
fellows, my ancestors, Wrastling Brewster
and Preserved Fish, and the rest, or we'd
both be strung up for practicing the
black arts, although such names as they
had were enough to choke them without
hanging.</p>

<p>"Well, my small wizard, go it is, since
your suggestion suits my inclination; who
knows? who knows?" He sat absently
stroking the little cat, who had returned
to the table, and it was evident that something
had given him food for deep, and
not altogether unpleasant, reflection, for
the evening paper lay untouched, and the
open fire seemed to hold the man's fixed
attention. Was it Kittyboy's sorceries
that caused past events to rise as flames
from ashes, to add a new warmth to a half-chilled
memory?</p>

<p>The next morning it was that Dr.
Brewster turned his steps toward a quiet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
street in a modest quarter of the city. An
open square gave a pleasant, airy appearance
to the neighborhood. The sun was
shining brightly, but the air was frosty, and
the doctor stepped along briskly. His footsteps
did not falter until he reached the
house, 610 West Twelfth Street, and then
for a moment he paused, taking off his
hat and wiping his brow as if it were a
warm day. Immediately after, however,
he mounted the steps with a firm step and
gave the bell a vigorous pull. It was
answered by a neat maid, who paused
expectantly for the card, which the doctor
did not produce. "Tell Mrs. Temple a
friend wishes to see her," was his message.</p>

<p>He was ushered into a small room,
which was warm and cosy. A fire glowed
in a Baltimore heater. There were pretty,
tasteful articles scattered about, which
gave the room a cheerful, homelike look.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
The doctor picked up a book from the
table, put it down again, nervously took
two or three turns up and down the floor,
and finally stationed himself, with his hands
behind him, at one of the windows, fixing
his eyes upon the street.</p>

<p>Presently some one entered, and a soft
voice said, "You wished to see me?"</p>

<p>The doctor turned abruptly, and held
out his hand to the tall, fair woman who
stood before him. "Elinor," he said,&mdash;the
color mounted to the lady's cheek,&mdash;"Dr.
Brewster," she faltered. "How&mdash;where
did you learn of me?"</p>

<p>"At the club," replied the doctor,
gravely and truthfully.</p>

<p>"It is truly good to see an old friend,"
continued Mrs. Temple. "You know&mdash;you
have heard."</p>

<p>"I know nothing but that you are
here," answered the doctor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"My husband died two years ago,"
went on Mrs. Temple. "He was very good
to me, and he idolized our little daughter."
Her eyes dropped before the doctor's
earnest gaze, but they had already told
that which the doctor had for so many
years longed to know, whether in marrying
big, wealthy, dissipated Captain Temple,
Elinor Arsquith had pleased merely herself,
or whether to spare her father's good
name she had sacrificed her girlhood.</p>

<p>He drew in his breath quickly, and for
a moment no word was spoken between
them.</p>

<p>"And your little girl?" asked the
doctor, breaking the silence.</p>

<p>"She is with me here. I lost two little
ones in Texas, and Elinor is all I have left.
I felt that for her sake I must seek a different
climate, and that is why I am here."</p>

<p>At that moment the curtains before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
door parted, and a small figure appeared.
A solemn-faced little midget, about six
years old, clasping to her breast a battered
doll, stood before them.</p>

<p>"Come in, dear, and speak to the
doctor," Mrs. Temple said, glad of an
interruption to a conversation which was
becoming embarrassing.</p>

<p>The little one advanced slowly, till she
stood by the doctor's side. "Must I put
out my tongue?" she asked.</p>

<p>The doctor smiled. "No, I think I
wouldn't. It's pretty cold for even a tongue
to be out to-day."</p>

<p>The child laughed merrily. "I wanted
to go and buy mamma a little bunch of
vi'lets, but she said I would freeze my
nose off, and I wouldn't be pretty without
any nose, would I?" Then, glancing down
at her dilapidated, noseless doll, she looked
a little abashed. "Excuse me, Lily," she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
said gravely; "I didn't mean to hurt your
feelings. I love you just as much as if
you had as big a nose as the doctor's.
I didn't have any money in my bank, anyhow,"
she continued, "and mamma could
not spare any five centses. You know
we aren't rich any more. I 'spect the
flowers are frozen up, anyway."</p>

<p>"I'll get the violets for you," said the
doctor, without looking at Mrs. Temple.
"I know a nice, warm place where they
live, and if you'll trust me I think I can
find some fresh, sweet ones."</p>

<p>Elinor clasped her hands. "You're
very nice," she assured him. "And if you
won't give me any nasty medicine, I'll
love you very much."</p>

<p>"I promise no nasty medicine," agreed
the doctor, and their friendship was sealed.
So well did it proceed that when the doctor
took his leave, an hour later, Elinor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
hugged him frantically, saying, "Doctor,
come to-morrow. I get so lonely, and so
does mamma. I wish you'd come every
day," and the doctor's smile answered the
suggestion.</p>

<p>"Mamma," said the child, after the
doctor had left them, "is that a very nice
man?"</p>

<p>"Why, darling; yes&mdash;of course&mdash;yes&mdash;he
is very nice."</p>

<p>"I fought so," she returned confidently.
"Is he very 'spensive?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you mean&mdash;wealthy. I think
so, enough so, at all events. What
funny questions. Why do you want to
know?"</p>

<p>"Just 'cause I like to ask funny questions.
Mamma, do you like bread?"</p>

<p>"Why, you midget, you are just asking
questions to tease your mudder. You
know I like bread."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Elinor laughed gleefully, and looked
down at her doll. "Lily told me a secret
to-day," she said, "and she won't let me
tell till Christmas. It's a very nice one,
but I can't tell you, mamma."</p>

<p>"Very well. I will wait till Christmas."</p>

<p>"Don't you want to know it?" the
child asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Not if you don't want to tell it."</p>

<p>"But I do, only Lily won't let me.
Mamma, this morning I was a kitten."</p>

<p>"You were? I didn't discover it."</p>

<p>"I was. I had a red ribbon round my
neck, and I was black, and Lily was Elinor
Temple, and she played with me. See
where I scratched her. Do you want me
to be a kitten for you, mamma?"</p>

<p>"Not if you scratch, nor if you have
to turn black."</p>

<p>That amused Elinor greatly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"I doesn't have to. I've just make-believe
claws. Mamma, are you going to
take me to church on Christmas?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course. Don't you want
to go?"</p>

<p>"I didn't last Sunday; it was so long.
The man in the white gown said so much.
I fink he was a chatterbox."</p>

<p>"Why, Elinor! what a thing to say
about the good rector."</p>

<p>"Well, mamma, it is what you say
about me when I talk a long time, and
you love me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Temple smiled. "Then you don't
want to go to church on Christmas?"</p>

<p>"Oh, but I do; I like to hear the little
boys sing, and I like to see the green
things, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You get tired sitting so long?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, mamma; I couldn't get tired;
I get too much rested."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"I see. Well, dearie, we will go to
the early service, which is not so long."</p>

<p>"And then come home and have the
Santa Claus part of it for dessert; that
will be nice. I wish the doctor would
come soon; I want to ask him somefing."</p>

<p>The doctor did come soon. Indeed,
there was scarcely a day after this which
did not see his stalwart form turning into
the quiet street, and the affection between
the grave man and the pretty child grew
apace, so that many confidences passed
between them.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 2.5em;">CHAPTER III</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> afternoon the two were cosily
occupying one big chair, in the
absence of Mrs. Temple, who was glad to
leave her treasure so well satisfied to
stay at home, while she attended to some
Christmas shopping.</p>

<p>"Let's talk about Christmas," said
Elinor, cuddling down by the side of the
doctor, after watching her mother out of
sight.</p>

<p>"Isn't there a Santa Claus?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"So I have always been told."</p>

<p>"There, I said so; Bill says there isn't."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"And who is Bill?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a friend of mine," returned Elinor,
jauntily.</p>

<p>"I should like to know something about
him."</p>

<p>"Oh, he's just a boy with&mdash;&mdash;" she
clapped her hands over her mouth, and
looked, with eyes full of laughter, at the
doctor.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Oh, doctor, it isn't nice to make
remarks about the dress of your friends,"
returned the little monkey, drawing down
her mouth demurely, and looking up
mischievously from under her long
lashes.</p>

<p>"Then suppose we don't mention his
dress. Tell me something else about
him."</p>

<p>"He has a very dirty face," said Elinor,
with a little chuckle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"He has? That is unfortunate. Why
doesn't he wash it?"</p>

<p>"I reckon 'cause he hasn't any soap or
towels."</p>

<p>"But he can get water easily."</p>

<p>"Yes; but, doctor, don't you know how
horrid it is to have your face washed, and
to stand with it all dripping, 'specially in
cold weather? and if you had no towel,
you know, you wouldn't want to wash your
face, either."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not. Well, Bill is a boy with
a dirty face. Is that all? Has he nothing
else to boast of?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he has a sister named Gerty.
I s'pose she has a dirty face, too. I never
saw her, 'cause she's got the rickets, and
her grandfather has had yaller janders; but
they is about gone. I think they must be
rather pretty, don't you?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, the yaller janders. It sounds
like some sort of a flower, I always fink of&mdash;what
are the yellow fings that come in
the spring&mdash;the early ones?"</p>

<p>"Daffodils?"</p>

<p>Elinor shook her head. "Not zactly;
mamma said they were about the same."</p>

<p>"Oh, jonquils."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it; are they anything
alike?"</p>

<p>"Like what? Daffodils?"</p>

<p>"No; like yaller janders. Are yaller
jonquils anything like them?"</p>

<p>"No. I can't say that they are."</p>

<p>"Have you any at your house?"</p>

<p>The doctor laughed&mdash;"Fortunately, no,
I know of none nearer than a hospital."</p>

<p>"Oh, do they grow in hospitals?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes."</p>

<p>"Will you take me there and show them
to me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't believe you would be particularly
pleased to see anyone with what Bill
calls 'yaller janders.'"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because it is not a very pleasant disease
to gaze upon."</p>

<p>"Is it a sickness? Oh, I'm so disypointed.
I fought they were flowers, and
I was so glad the old grandfather had
them. That's a dreffel disypointment,"
she added, after a moment's silence.</p>

<p>"But you have not told me about
Bill," the doctor reminded her. "Where
did you meet him&mdash;at a party?"</p>

<p>"No-o," contemptuously. "I met him
in the square. He sells vi'lets. I reckon
that's why I fought his grandfather had
flowers&mdash;yaller jander flowers.&mdash;Is bronicles
flowers?"</p>

<p>"I never heard of them."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, I s'pect that's another disease.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
You see it fooled me to see Bill
selling vi'lets. I kind of fought he had a
big garden full, or his grandfather had.
He said his grandfather used to go out
selling flowers till sumfing got the matter
with his bronicles, and they couldn't stand
the east wind."</p>

<p>The doctor laughed so heartily that
Elinor looked quite aggrieved.</p>

<p>"I'll not tell you any more," she said,
"if you make fun of me, and I was going
to tell you lots."</p>

<p>"Oh, please pardon my laughter. I'll
try not to be so silly again. You see, I
sometimes laugh at nothing at all. It is a
habit I have formed from living alone."</p>

<p>Elinor looked at him very soberly.
She wasn't quite sure whether this was
earnest or not, but his being alone seemed
a sufficient excuse, and, moreover, appealed
to her sympathies, so she took hold of one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
of her friend's big fingers, and held it
confidingly.</p>

<p>"Tell me truly," she said, "do you
believe in Santa Claus?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly. I think he is the
greatest invention of any age."</p>

<p>"Oh, good! That sounds so certain
sure. That's what Connie says. I didn't
make it up. I did make up sumfing once."</p>

<p>"You did? What was it?"</p>

<p>"A&mdash;&mdash;I don't know what to call it.
I'll tell you, and then you'll know." She
nestled her golden head against the doctor's
shoulder, and looked up in his face.
"I was jumping in the cellar one day
with Ida Miller, and I made a tree-men-jus
jump, and I said, 'Oh, Ida, I made a
jump right smite the javelin.' Don't you
fink that's fine? I have said it over lots
of times, 'cause I like the way it sounds,
somefing like the Bible, you know."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think it is one of the most grandiloquent
phrases I ever heard. You do not
know how I admire it."</p>

<p>"Do you, really?"</p>

<p>"Yes, really."</p>

<p>"Then, I'm glad I told you. Now, I'll
tell you somefing else. It's a secret, but
Lily said I might tell you. She won't let
me tell mamma. It's about Bill. Do you
want to hear it?"</p>

<p>"Very much."</p>

<p>"And you won't tell?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Cross your heart?"</p>

<p>"Yes; cross my heart."</p>

<p>"Then, it is this: Bill said he didn't
believe there wa'n't no Santa Claus. He
said it just that way." She stopped and
looked searchingly at the doctor, but he
was listening attentively.</p>

<p>She gave her little mirthful chuckle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and went on. "Then I said, 'if you write
to him, and he brings you what you ask,
I reckon you'll believe in him,' and he said
he'd be a blamed fool to do such a fing.
He said blamed fool&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right, he said blamed fool."</p>

<p>Elinor buried her head in the doctor's
sleeve and laughed silently. Then she
looked up with eyes still full of mirth.
"That was so funny," she said.</p>

<p>"What was?"</p>

<p>"To hear you say blamed fool. Did
you ever say it before?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>"Don't you like to say it? I do. I
go off in the corner and say it to Lily
sometimes, just 'cause I like to hear
myself. Do you do that?"</p>

<p>"Go off by myself and say it to Lily?
I haven't any Lily."</p>

<p>"No, of course, but you might say it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
just the same to a chair&mdash;or&mdash;or anyfing.
Mamma says it's not nice for a lady to say
it, and that's why I'm doing it all I can
now, 'cause I'll be a lady some day, and
then I can't. There are lots of fings that
way. Anyhow, Bill said it, and I told him
he was an aggynorstic. That sounds like a
dreadful word, but it isn't, for I heard
mamma call somebody that, and I asked
her what it meant, and she said it
meant a person that doesn't believe. I
fought it would scare Bill, for I fink
it has a scary sound, like the day of
wrath."</p>

<p>The doctor turned away his head, and,
taking out his handkerchief, buried his face
in it, a violent fit of coughing seeming to
overtake him.</p>

<p>Elinor looked quite alarmed, but the
doctor assured her it was only a small
matter, and though very red in the face,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
he resumed a grave demeanor and asked
Elinor to continue her tale.</p>

<hr class="chap" style="page-break-after: always;" />

<p>"Well," she went on, "'then Bill,' I said,
'you're an aggynorstic,' and he stared at
me so hard. 'I don't like aggynorstics,' I
said, and he said 'what'll I do about it?'
And I said, 'you write to Santa Claus just
like'&mdash;&mdash;Oh, my! I was just going to
tell such a precious secret. I won't,
though&mdash;&mdash;Anyhow, I made him promise
he'd write to Santa Claus if I'd buy
vi'lets whenever I had any money in my
bank. And he did write, and now I
reckon he'll find out. He's real e'cited
over it."</p>

<p>"And where does he live?"</p>

<p>"Oh, back in a little street that runs
skwy-eyed, Connie says, across this. It's a
horrid little street, and mamma won't let
me go there, but I know where it is."</p>

<p>"And where does Bill sell his violets?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"In the square, by the fountain. He
has beautiful red hair and the loveliest
freckles you ever saw. I wish I had freckles
and red hair; don't you?"</p>

<p>"I can't say that I do desire them
greatly, and I'm sure I like you much
better as you are."</p>

<p>"Do you? Well, maybe you do, but
I don't. Do you fink Santa Claus got
Bill's letter? I hope he did, for it seems
dreadful for anyone to have no Santa Claus
and no Christmas; it makes me feel sorry
inside, as if I had eaten too many cakes.
Do you fink he got it?"</p>

<p>"That depends upon where he mailed
it."</p>

<p>"Why, in the post-office box, of course.
The one on the corner, by the square, that
says U. S. mail on it. What makes them
turn it hind part before? Why don't they
say mail us? It means the letters you put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
in, of course. It's so the man with the
funny little wagon will know."</p>

<p>The doctor frowned; then he laughed.
It was such a funny translation of the U. S.
mail. But just such fantastic ideas he
knew took possession of the child. "That's
all right," he said. "Uncle Sam does put
things wrong-end-foremost sometimes.
You tell Bill that if he put his letter in the
box there's not the slightest doubt but that
it will be answered."</p>

<p>"I saw him put it in. He showed it
to me, and I went with him to mail it. He
can write pretty well, for he went to school
before that time; about&mdash;about the bronicles,
you know."</p>

<p>The doctor nodded understandingly.</p>

<p>"Do you believe Santa Claus will have
enough turkeys to go around? Mamma
says, if he hasn't, I may send Bill and
Gerty some of mine. I'm going to try to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
eat a very little piece, but I like turkey,
and I hope Bill and Gerty will have a whole
one to themselves, and I hope Gerty will
get a doll, and if she doesn't, I'll have to
send her the one Santa Claus brings me."</p>

<p>"Why would you have to?"</p>

<p>"Why, 'cause I wouldn't be such a
piggy-wiggy as to keep two, and she not
have any. It wouldn't be nice of me,
when I have Lily. Could you have lots
of fings when you knew somebody else
didn't have any?"</p>

<p>This was a home thrust, made so truthfully
and innocently that the doctor wondered
why all these years' Christmastide
had not brought home to him such a
reproach. He had eaten, drunken, been
comfortable and care free, while just such
opportunities had been waiting for him as
this year offered.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, as he took his departure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
"it's all right about Santa Claus,
you tell Bill."</p>

<p>"And you won't tell anyone," whispered
Elinor.</p>

<p>He assured her that the secret was
safe, and went off with a very warm feeling
inside. There seemed to be an expansiveness
of light in the setting sun; a
brightness about existence in general,
which even cases of "yaller janders"
and weak "bronicles" could not overshadow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">"I must</span> look after that family," mused
the doctor. "Bless the young things!
a frolicsome kitten and a little earnest child,
full of faith and love of human kind, can
be wonderful factors in the matter of happiness.
Strange how I have gone along
missing both and not knowing what I
missed. Let me see. I'll send Hooper to
look after grandfather's 'bronicles;' he
smiled broadly at the remembrance of the
garbled word. I'd rather not have the
little one know that I've a hand in it, and
'twill be good for Hooper to try his hand
at that sort of thing. Let me see if that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
youngster's letter reached its proper destination."
He stopped and pulled out the
packet he carried.</p>

<p>Yes, there it was, signed "Bill." The
doctor stood and read the poor smudgy,
mis-spelled little missive over, put it back
in his pocket, and walked thoughtfully on,
not knowing that at that very moment he
was passing the writer, who, with his meagre
supply of wan-looking violets, was
offering them for sale.</p>

<p>Bill as little knew that the letter over
which he had spent much thought and
hard labor was resting in the doctor's
pocket, for he imagined it to be in the
hands of a red-nosed, white-haired individual,
with a jolly countenance and a
twinkling eye&mdash;such a one as could be
seen, more or less realistically represented
in shop windows. A very different looking
person, indeed, from this portly, prosperous-appearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
man with the keen eyes,
who wore "swagger clothes, and didn't
care nothin' fer poor cusses, or he'd 'a
bought somethin' from a feller." Bill's ire
was roused by this kind of person, so indifferent
and absent-minded, as never even
to glance at the violets, nor give a regretful
negative, as some nice ladies did.</p>

<p>"Talk about old Santa Claus," muttered
Bill, "if he is anybody at all, he ain't
friends to nobody but rich folks; that's
what I say. I ain't never heard from him, an'
I guess I ain't never goin' to, what's more."</p>

<p>But, as if to chide his lack of faith,
Elinor herself appeared like a reproving
angel at his side. "Bill," she said, standing
on tip-toe that she might see the box-cover
in which the violets lay, "Bill, have
you sold lots to-day?"</p>

<p>"No, I ain't," he answered, rather
crossly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, then, I can spend all these five
centses. The doctor picked them all out of
his pocket for me, and told me to buy
vi'lets for mamma. So, I have to. Ten
five centses, see. I told mamma I would
come right back. She is watching out of
the window for me."</p>

<p>Bill's face took on a little sunshine.
Ten bunches! Why, it would nearly clean
out his stock. What luck!</p>

<p>"Say," he said, in a low voice, "'bout
that Santa Claus, you know. Time's gittin'
clost."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Elinor, eagerly holding
out her hands to receive the violets.</p>

<p>"I don't believe he comes to poor
folks," continued Bill; "mind, I don't say
there ain't no Santa Claus; but I say he
ain't no friend o' folks what lives in
Hitchen's court."</p>

<p>"Oh, but he is. Dr. Brewster says so,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and he knows everyfing&mdash;he does truly&mdash;and
he told me to tell you that there was
a Santa Claus, really, really." Bill stared
at the ground. "And he said if you put
your letter in the box, Santa Claus will
surely get it there, and you will get an
answer. So, now," and she walked off
with a little switch of her skirts, and a
decided sort of air, as she would say there
was no further doubt possible.</p>

<p>Bill looked after her. Ten bunches of
violets meant a corresponding amount of
faith, and an hour later an empty box lid
went home with him. But the very fact of
the emptiness of the box cover meant a
fullness of belief. And Gerty; poor little,
rickety Gerty, also received a prop to her
faltering hopes in Bill's words. "They
are a Sandy Claus, Gert, sure as shootin'!
A big bug what I knows about says so.
Ain't you glad?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you goin' to believe in him?"
asked Gerty, in an excited whisper.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," sturdily returned Bill.</p>

<p>"So'm I, then," answered Gerty. "I'm
goin' to believe he'll bring me a doll, and
a&mdash;a orange, and a&mdash;a new frock, and a&mdash;a
picture book and candy, and&mdash;" her whisper
rose shrilly as she became more ambitious,
"and a&mdash;a turkey!" The climax was
reached.</p>

<p>"Sho!" said Bill, doubtfully, "I don't
believe he'll do all that."</p>

<p>"What's the use of believing at all if
you don't believe he can do every bit?"
returned Gerty, who did not regard half
measures with favor. "I'm goin' to believe
I'll git it all&mdash;and more," she added, with
an extra touch of defiance of fate.</p>

<p>Bill looked at her half-admiringly. Such
temerity was beyond his mental stature,
although, given a proper field for physical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
valor, and he'd show no white feather, as
various urchins in the neighborhood could
testify.</p>

<p>"How long is it before Christmas?"
asked Gerty. "Three days, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"'Bout that. Say, Gert, we ain't ast
fur nothin' fur grandpop in that letter."</p>

<p>"Why, yes, we did. We ast fur a doctor
to cure his bronicles. Don't you know?"</p>

<p>"So we did. How is he?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, he's kinder yaller yit,
an' he can't eat much."</p>

<p>A sharp rap at the door interrupted
them, and a smiling young man entered to
to their "Come in."</p>

<p>"Is this&mdash;Bill?" he asked.</p>

<p>The boy nodded.</p>

<p>"Your grandfather, he's ill?"</p>

<p>"Hm-hm," returned Bill, looking suspiciously
at the visitor's careful attire.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes." The young man put up an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
eye-glass and peered around the dingy
rooms, Bill meantime eying him, as much
as to say, what business is it of yours how
we look?</p>

<p>"Could I see him?" queried the young
man.</p>

<p>"I dunno. See here. What d'yer
want? I'll pay yer rent. Yer needn't go
badgerin' gran'pop about it."</p>

<p>The young man stared. "Bless me,
my son. I don't want any rent. I'm," he
smiled, and whimsically took out his
card case. "Pardon me for not properly
introducing myself. I am Dr. Hooper, and
I have been asked to call professionally
on your grandfather by a friend of his."</p>

<p>"Whew!" Bill gave voice to a low
whistle, and glanced at Gerty, who had
taken the card with a funny little air of
polite acceptance, and, at a word from her
brother, led the way into a hole of a room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
hardly more than a closet, where an old
man lay.</p>

<p>The doctor remained about fifteen or
twenty minutes, and when he again came
into the presence of the boy and his sister,
he said:</p>

<p>"I think your grandfather will be better
under my immediate care, and I will see
that he is removed&mdash;if&mdash;if you don't object&mdash;to
a pleasant room in a pleasant place."</p>

<p>"An 'orspital?" queried Gerty.</p>

<p>The young man nodded.</p>

<p>"Say, look here, he ain't goin' to no
'orspital," objected Bill.</p>

<p>"He is, too," retorted Gerty; then
turning to the doctor, "You can take
him." She gave the permission grandly.
"I know all about it and Bill don't. I've
seen one."</p>

<p>"My son," said the doctor, addressing
Bill, "your sister is a person of unusual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
acumen. She&mdash;she knows a good thing
when she sees it. I give you my word that
the friend of whom I spoke thoroughly
approves of your grandfather's removal."</p>

<p>"And can't we see him?" asked Bill,
looking very dubious.</p>

<p>"Bless you, yes, every day, if you want
to."</p>

<p>"And will you bring him back for
Christmas?" asked Bill again.</p>

<p>The doctor considered. "If it is possible.
At least, I can promise you shall
eat your Christmas dinner together."</p>

<p>The two children exchanged glances.
The answer implied that there was to be a
Christmas dinner.</p>

<p>"I will come to-morrow morning in
my carriage for him," added the doctor.
"That is, if I may."</p>

<p>"Yer hear that, Gert? A kerridge.
Ain't we swagger?" and Bill laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>He followed the young doctor to the
door, and shut it after him as he went outside.
Plucking him by the sleeve, he asked
in a low tone, "Mister doctor, that there
friend what sent you. Say, honest now,
tell a fellow square. Was it old Sandy
Claus?"</p>

<p>The doctor hesitated, looked down at
the earnest, ugly little face, lighted up by
a strong hope, its dirt and unhealthy
color but dimly descried in the flaring
light of the dingy court, and he felt a
new concern for this "gutter-snipe" with
whom he had suddenly come in contact.
He laughed softly and said, "Yes; you're
about right. Call him Santa Claus."</p>

<p>Bill went in and shut the door very
solemnly. Things were happening mysteriously,
and he felt somewhat awed at
what his experiences implied.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 3em; margin-bottom: 2.5em;">CHAPTER V</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr.</span> Brewster received a call from his
young assistant that same evening.
He entered with a bored, blase air into the
doctor's study, and stood staring, and,
slapping his gloves together as if he had
not one single idea in his noddle. Then
he spoke.</p>

<p>"The old fellow&mdash;in Hitchen's Court,
you know&mdash;beastly dirty hole, by the way&mdash;he
needs looking after, wants a sunny
room and good nourishment, and all that
sort of thing. He'll get worse if he stays
there. I'm going to take him to our hospital,
if you don't mind."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Take him?" the doctor chuckled.</p>

<p>The young man flushed, "Yes. Bah
Jove! I can't see an old fellow like that,
don't you know, dying for want of a little
attention. Now, doctor, I'm no charity
fiend, but&mdash;I say, what are you chuckling
about?"</p>

<p>"At your past record in the matter of
pet charities, and your open expressions
regarding those who have them. Go on,
Sig, my dear fellow. You said you'd take
him."</p>

<p>The young man flung off his overcoat,
displaying his evening dress and the flower
in his button-hole. "Yes, I said <i>take</i> him&mdash;in
my carriage to-morrow morning."
He looked up, as if expecting protest.</p>

<p>"Bless you, man, I don't object if you
don't," returned the older man. "He's an
old fraud, doubtless, has no 'bronicles' to
speak of, and wouldn't know 'yaller janders'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
from scarlet fever. Where do you
purpose placing him?"</p>

<p>"In the pay ward," said the young
doctor, defiantly.</p>

<p>Dr. Brewster threw back his head and
laughed.</p>

<p>"But, I say, doctor," continued the
other, "you ought to see him, such a pitiful-looking,
white-haired, old chap, with
those kids on his hands for years. I say,
he's been handicapped, you know. And&mdash;Bah
Jove! doctor, what did you send
me there for?"</p>

<p>"To see how you liked Hitchen's
Court."</p>

<p>The young man passed over the reply.
"I say it's a beastly shame," he went on.
"That old chap is a better fellow than I am
any day, I say, there's something wrong."</p>

<p>"Desperately so, I grant you&mdash;with
us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>The young man looked up quickly.
"It's beastly," he repeated.</p>

<p>"Sig, you're a huge joke," laughed the
doctor. "Go 'long with you and your paupers.
By the way, what about the children?"</p>

<p>The young man smiled broadly. "They
are a pair. I believe that poor little wretch
of a red-headed snipe supports the family.
Ah, doctor, I say we're nowhere with my
Lord William. Such airs; bluffed me off
at first."</p>

<p>He sat on the arm of the chair,
swinging one foot thoughtfully. Dr. Brewster
looked at him. Young, good-looking,
rich; what the public called "a howling
swell;" a dilettante in his profession, yet
possessing ability, if but the proper motive
stirred his impulses. He had been wont
to maintain that half the world's poor were
whining impostors, and the other half
incorrigible reprobates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>The elder man watched him with a
half smile. "You'll take the old man, then,
and I'll see to the young ones," he
remarked after a time.</p>

<p>Sigourney Hooper slipped on his overcoat
again. "By the way," he said, "they
think Santa Claus sent me," and he gave a
grin of amusement.</p>

<p>Dr. Brewster looked grave. "Who is
Santa Claus, anyhow?" he returned.
"The embodiment of goodness, charity
and kindly feeling."</p>

<p>"They were right, then," replied Sigourney,
holding out his hand. "We'll have to
give them a Christmas, doctor, for I promised
not to keep grandfather from the
bosom of his family on that festal day.
Holy Moses! Festivities in that hole!
Ugh!"</p>

<p>Dr. Brewster sat smiling to himself
long after his visitor had departed. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
wheel within a wheel, the ripples caused
by the dropping of the smallest of pebbles;
the movings toward a broad humanity set
astir by the prattle of a child; by the
instinctive appeal for warmth and protection
made by a little hunted animal; the
breath of the spirit on the face of the
waters! He pondered over these mysterious
forces, while Kittyboy purred contentedly
at his elbow.</p>

<p>Kittyboy fared well these days. He
never failed to station himself by the
doctor's chair at meal time, and was so
indulged in the matter of tid-bits that
his coat grew as sleek as satin; and if he
had not been of such a very volatile temperament,
it is quite likely that he would
have become fat and lazy.</p>

<p>The housekeeper confided to Maggie
that something had made the doctor grow
ten years younger, and the housemaid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
immediately attributed the fact to the
presence of Kittyboy. Certain it is that
the doctor busied himself with many things
to which he had heretofore seemed indifferent,
and his sober establishment underwent
all sorts of changes. "All on account of
the cat," said Maggie.</p>

<p>A well-to-do physician who has retained
just enough practice to keep him contented
is rather an enviable individual, and Dr.
Brewster looked the picture of genial content
as he stepped into his carriage on
Christmas Eve. Just where he went was
best known to his coachman, who had long
ago learned the value of keeping his own
counsel. But the faith in Santa Claus
which that evening justified was felt in
more than one wretched dwelling. Especially
did two anxious little souls, who had
staked their last hope on the letter they
had sent, feel that their mustard seed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
belief had indeed grown to gigantic size
when hampers and bundles from Santa
Claus were displayed to their glad and
astonished eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, Bill, I said I believed he'd bring all
I wanted, and more," cried Gerty, laughing
and crying at the same time. "And he
did, he did. And grandpop's gone to stay
in that grand room and get well, and I'm
goin' to get well, and we've a whole turkey
and fixins, Bill, fixins. I never said nothin'
about them. And gran'pop 'll be here an'
help us eat it. An', oh, Bill. They are a
Sandy Claus, they are, ain't they?"</p>

<p>"Well, I should smile," replied Bill,
surveying the bountiful supplies before
him.</p>

<p>"An' you'll tell that little gal first thing,
won't you?" said Gerty.</p>

<p>"Won't I!" returned Bill, too happy
for more speech.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>The doctor paced the floor a long time
that night. He thought of many things;
of the dreary dwellings he had that day
seen; of the sorrowing poor; of the little
it had taken to make a few hearts glad,
and most of all he thought of little Elinor
Temple and her mother. He remembered
a Christmas Eve which had promised him
a great joy, but which had brought him a
great sorrow&mdash;the sorrow which he had
kept locked in his heart for fifteen long
years. Not once had he faltered in his
faith in the girl who had turned from the
young physician, just starting on his career,
and had married rollicking Captain Temple.
Dr. Brewster smiled sadly as he
remembered how Mrs. Temple had said
but the day before: "We sometimes make
errors of judgment, but if we err from a
mistaken motive of unselfishness, we suffer
just the same." And that had told the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
whole story. It was the only justification
she had ever attempted, the only reference
to what he knew she must have endured;
but he had inadvertently heard many things
during these past weeks. He had re-read,
with fresh delight, an old chapter in his life.
He had opened his heart to the love of an
innocent child, and the door being open,
what else fair and beautiful might not find
admittance.</p>

<p>There was a rare exultation in the doctor's
smile, as the bells rang in the midnight
hour, and declared the promise of
peace and good will.</p>

<p>On Christmas morning around Kittyboy's
neck was fastened, by the doctor's
own hand, a bright red ribbon. Then he
was placed in a basket and deposited upon
the cushions of the doctor's carriage.</p>

<p>With the basket in his hand, Dr.
Brewster entered Mrs. Temple's cozy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
sitting-room, where a hearty welcome
awaited him.</p>

<p>"Elinor has such a host of pretty
things," said the child's mother, "and yet
she seems a little disappointed. She tells
me there are two gifts she specially wanted,
which Santa Claus did not bring her, but
she will not tell me what they are."</p>

<p>"I think I know," returned the doctor,
smiling. "Come here, Dot, Santa Claus
asked me to bring your gifts to you,
because he could not trust any one else,
and he knew I'd take better care of them
than some others."</p>

<p>Elinor looked at him gravely from
under her long lashes, and watched eagerly
while he uncovered the basket, from out
of which jumped a sleek black little kitten,
which stretched himself comfortably, looking
up with friendly eyes at the doctor.</p>

<p>"Oh, mine own Jollity!" cried Elinor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
"Oh, mamma, see! Oh, isn't Santa Claus
good?" and she clasped Kittyboy rapturously
in her arms. "And the other
present," she said, laughing, "you couldn't
bring that in a basket."</p>

<p>"It is here, if mamma will let you keep
it," and the doctor took the child on his
knee, hiding his face in her curly locks.
"Tell mamma what it is," he whispered.</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma," cried the child, "I
wrote to Santa Claus and asked him for a
new kitty and a new papa. That was the
secret Lily and I had." For a moment she
looked puzzled, and then a light broke
over her face, while she let the kitten go,
and clasped the doctor's neck closer, closer.
"And, oh mamma," she continued, "when
Santa Claus has sent me such a beautiful,
'spensive papa, you will let me keep him,
won't you?" And the mother, amid
laughter and blushes, could not say her nay.</p>

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
